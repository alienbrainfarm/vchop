# Working Agreement for vchop Project

## Environment Setup
- All development must use a Python virtual environment (`venv`).
- The `venv` should be created in the project root and activated before installing dependencies or running code.
- Dependencies must be managed using `requirements.txt`.

## Development Process
- Work in small, incremental steps. Each change should be focused and manageable.
- Every new function or feature should be accompanied by unit tests where possible.
- Code should be committed frequently with clear, descriptive messages.
- Pull requests (if using GitHub or similar) should be reviewed before merging.

## Testing
- Unit tests are required for all new functions and modules.
- Functional testing by the user is expected when new features are introduced.
- Automated test suites should be run before each commit or merge.

## Collaboration
- Communicate regularly about progress and blockers.
- Document major decisions and changes in the `docs/` directory.
- Keep the `README.md` and documentation up to date as the project evolves.

## Code Quality
- Follow Python best practices and style guides (PEP8).
- Refactor code as needed to maintain readability and maintainability.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback to the user.
